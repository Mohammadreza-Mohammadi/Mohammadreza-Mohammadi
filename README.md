### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hi, My name is Mohammadreza Mohammadi and I am a software engineer.
I am passionate about technology, innovation, and big challenging tasks on my to-do list.
My stack is .net in the back end and angular or react in the front end. (love to learn and study other languages too)
I love to write code and share it with people they sometimes fix my fault and sometimes we will be friends. 
and I like to see other people's code too to learn and get an idea of how they write code and solve problems.
I like to hear about you if you want to contact me about programming.
